## [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers

## Container

A container is nothing but a running process, with some added encapsulation features applied to it in order to keep it isolated from the host and from other containers

Each container interacts with its own private filesystem; this filesystem is provided by a Docker image


## Image

An image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.
